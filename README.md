AeroTwin is a modular, plug-and-play digital twin for modern airports and airside operations. It combines highly realistic 3D modeling with live or simulated aircraft movements, offering a unified view of land and airside activities.

## Key Features of AeroTwin

Our AeroTwin platform offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to revolutionize airport operations and training:

* **Realistic 3D Environments:** Experience highly detailed and accurate 3D representations of terminals, aprons, and runways, providing an immersive and true-to-life operational view.
* **Game Engine-like Simulations:** Benefit from realistic simulations of aircraft landings and departures on runways, powered by advanced game engine technology for unparalleled visual fidelity and physics.
* **Dynamic Aircraft Movement:** Real-time aircraft movement simulation integrated with live transponder data, offering an accurate and up-to-the-minute view of airside activity.
* **Seamless System Integration:** Robust capabilities for integration with existing airport systems, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous (queue-based) communication methods.
* **Integrated RF Communications:** Comprehensive simulation of radio frequency communications, including cockpit-to-ATC interactions, ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System), ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service), and NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen).
* **API-Driven Platform:** A powerful API (Application Programming Interface) driven platform facilitating easy and flexible integration with various airport management systems such as AMS (Airport Management System), MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul), and BHS (Baggage Handling System).
* **Advanced Operational Insights:** Integration with real-time weather data, Turnaround Time (TAT) predictions, intelligent stand allocations, and comprehensive KPI (Key Performance Indicator) integration for optimized decision-making and performance monitoring.
